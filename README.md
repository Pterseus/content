# Welcome to the OMUSO Content Repository

The OMUSO Content Repository is dedicated to creating a comprehensive collection of classical texts, organized in a simple and accessible format using Markdown. This repository is a collaborative effort to gather, format, and maintain public domain books, making timeless literature available to all.

**Our goals**:

- Provide easy access to classical literature in a readable format.
- Preserve these texts for future generations.
- Encourage contributions to expand and improve the library.

By using Markdown, we ensure that these texts are easily accessible and can be utilized for various purposes, from personal reading to academic research.

This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from anyone interested in preserving and sharing the great works of literature.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by text title and language. Here's a basic outline:

```
/data/
  /The_Iliad/
    es.md
    en.md
    grc.md
    ...
  /The_Odyssey/
    es.md
    en.md
    grc.md
    ...
  ...
```

Each text is stored in a Markdown file within its respective title directory. Metadata such as the author, title, and publication date are included at the beginning of each file..

## How to Use

This repository is designed to be part of an ecosystem of repositories that will provide access to the content in the future. While we continue to develop and integrate these repositories, you can still make use of the files directly from this GitHub repository.

1. **Browsing the Library:** You can browse the library by navigating through the directories. Each Markdown file corresponds to a complete text of a classical work.

2. **Reading:** You can read the texts directly on GitHub or download them for offline reading.

3. **Searching:** Use the GitHub search functionality to find specific authors, titles, or keywords within the texts.
