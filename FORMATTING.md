# Formatting Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the repository, please follow these guidelines when adding or editing texts:

## Metadata

At the top of each Markdown file, include the following metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Iliada
author: Homer
language: ca
translator: Conrad Roure i Bofill
date: 1879-01-01
---
```

It is not necessary to define the `translator` field if it is the original work.

## Headings

- Use Markdown headings (#, ##, etc.) to structure the text.
- The title should be a level 1 heading (#).
- Chapter titles should be level 2 headings (##).
